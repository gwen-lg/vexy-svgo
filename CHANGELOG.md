## 2025-01-10 - Session 8: Documentation Consolidation and Structure Cleanup (Issue #211)

### Documentation Consolidation
- **Consolidated Documentation**: Merged all relevant information from `PLAN.md`, `WORK.md`, and other markdown files into comprehensive `TODO.md`
- **Removed Redundant Files**: Deleted obsolete markdown files to maintain single source of truth:
  - Removed `WORK.md`, `PLAN.md`, `AGENTS.md` (duplicate of CLAUDE.md)
  - Removed `work/SVGO_Vexy SVGO_PLUGIN_COMPARISON.md`
  - Note: `REFACTOR.md`, `LEAN.md`, `SPEC.md` were not found in the project
- **Enhanced TODO.md**: Added specific details about:
  - Missing plugin module declaration for `move_elems_attrs_to_group`
  - Status of 50 implemented plugins (94.3% SVGO compatibility)
  - Location of plugins in `crates/plugin-sdk/src/plugins/`
  - Reference to plugin migration guide

### Code Structure Cleanup
- **Fixed Missing Plugin Declaration**: Added `move_elems_attrs_to_group` module to `crates/plugin-sdk/src/plugins/mod.rs`
- **Cleaned Up Test Files**: Removed duplicate camelCase test files in `test/plugins/`
  - Kept snake_case versions to match plugin module naming convention
  - Removed 55 duplicate test files

### Project Architecture Clarification
- **Plugin Location**: Confirmed plugins are implemented in `crates/plugin-sdk/src/plugins/` (not `vexy_svgo/src/plugins/` as CLAUDE.md suggests)
- **vexy_svgo Crate Role**: Currently serves as a facade that re-exports functionality from core crates
- **No Code Duplication**: Verified no duplication between `vexy_svgo/` and `crates/` folders

### Next Priority
- Fix compilation errors listed in TODO.md to restore build stability
- Complete final 3 plugin migrations (convertPathData, applyTransforms) for 100% SVGO compatibility
- Update CLAUDE.md to reflect actual project structure
