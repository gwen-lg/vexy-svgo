The SVG optimization engine implements three core optimization modes:

## Multi-Mode Optimization
- Balanced: Default optimization balancing speed and compression
- Speed: Prioritizes fast processing over compression ratio
- Compression: Maximum size reduction with multiple optimization passes

Key optimization algorithms:

### Path Optimization
- Shape-to-path conversion with geometric simplification
- Path merging for compatible adjacent paths
- Coordinate precision reduction while preserving visual fidelity
- Arc optimization and conversion to simpler curve types

### Geometric Operations
- Transform matrix combination and simplification
- Shape conversion (ellipse to circle, rect to path)
- Coordinate space normalization
- Bounding box calculation and optimization

### Structure Optimization
- Group collapse based on render impact analysis
- Empty container removal with reference preservation
- Namespace cleanup with dependency tracking
- ID/class minification preserving external references

### Color Processing
- Format standardization (RGB to hex, names to hex)
- Gradient optimization and deduplication
- currentColor normalization
- Style attribute consolidation

## Processing Pipeline

The optimization process follows ordered phases:

1. Parse and validate SVG structure
2. Apply geometric optimizations
3. Execute path optimizations
4. Process colors and styles
5. Cleanup structure and metadata
6. Generate optimized output
