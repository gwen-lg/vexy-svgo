Read the @llms.txt code snapshot and into `vexify.txt` record all occurrences of all case variants of `vexy_svgo` found in the codebase. 

Write a `vexify.py` tool that will generally replace both in the current codebase and in the entire git history the name `vexy_svgo` with `vexy svgo` but in a smart way: 

- In filenames, it should replace `vexy_svgo` with `vexy_svgo`
- In code, it should replace `vexy_svgo` with `vexy_svgo` when it is used as a variable or function name, not in comments or strings.
- In documentation, comments and UI strings (like in HTML) it should replace the all-uppercase `Vexy SVGO` with `Vexy SVGO`.
- It should report all changes made, including filenames, code changes, and documentation updates, and then report the places where `vexy_svgo` still occurs.

Make it Fire CLI. If `--deep` is given, it should also rewrite the git history. Without `--deep`, it should only modify the current state of the codebase.
