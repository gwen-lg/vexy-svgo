Analyze the codebase ( @llms.txt is the snapshot ) and especially analyze the Github Pages website in @docs 

Into @PLAN.md develop a very detailed and specific plan so that we can have one end-user-suitable page that allows the end-user to drop an SVG file or paste SVG code, and have it converted: 

- One page should do it with `svgo`
- The other page should do it with `vexy_svgo` in WebAssembly

The pages should have identical designs, and should use DaisyUI with design compatible to the rest of the website (which is Jekyll with `just-the-docs` theme )
