Ensure that we build a single-file CLI tool, which works without any external dependencies, and also ensure that our build process produces deliverables for each platform in appropriate subfolders of @dist (`macos`, `windows`, `linux`) and in there we have not only the plain deliverable but also: (1)For macOS a .dmg that contains the .pkg which installs the CLI into /usr/local/bin (2) For Windows a .zip containing the CLI .exe (3) for Linux a .tgz containing the CLI executable
