# Vexy SVGO Work Progress - Current Iteration

## Current Focus: Phase 1 Code Cleanup (Immediate Priority)

### Immediate Items for This Iteration:
- [ ] Clean up all unused imports
- [ ] Remove or implement unused functions  
- [ ] Fix all compiler warnings
- [ ] Fix unused variable warnings (e.g., `file_path` is never read)

### Status:
Starting Phase 1 code cleanup to fix compiler warnings and unused code issues.

**Note:** Preserving `rust-version = "1.58.0"` in Cargo.toml as requested.

### Next Steps:
1. Run build to identify current warnings
2. Clean up unused imports systematically
3. Address unused functions and variables
4. Verify all warnings are resolved
