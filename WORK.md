# Vexy SVGO Work Progress - Current Iteration (2025-07-14)

## Current Iteration Tasks - Build Error Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

### 1. Build Error Analysis - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Analyzed build.err.txt for compilation errors**
  - Found multiple compilation errors in plugin-sdk tests and examples
  - Identified the following issues:
    1. Unresolved imports in property_tests.rs
    2. Method name changes: `get_plugin` → `create_plugin`
    3. Duplicate module definitions in test macros
    4. Type mismatches in plugin examples (String vs Cow<'_, str>)
    5. Wrong method signature for registry.register()
    6. One warning: unused variable `pretty_enabled` in optimizer_tests.rs
  
### 2. All Issues Fixed:
- ✅ Fixed import errors in crates/plugin-sdk/tests/property_tests.rs
  - Changed `crate::Plugin` to `vexy_svgo_plugin_sdk::Plugin`
  - Changed `crate::plugins::` to `vexy_svgo_plugin_sdk::plugins::`
- ✅ Updated registry_test.rs to use `create_plugin` instead of `get_plugin`
- ✅ Fixed duplicate module definitions in plugin test macros
  - Renamed 26 `mod tests` to `mod unit_tests` in plugin files
- ✅ Fixed type mismatches in plugin_composition.rs example
  - Changed String to Cow<'_, str> for attributes
- ✅ Updated registry.register() calls to match new signature
- ✅ Fixed unused variable warning in optimizer_tests.rs
  - Added underscore prefix to `_pretty_enabled`

### 3. Build Verification - COMPLETED
- ✅ Ran `./build.sh` to verify all fixes
- ✅ No compilation errors found
- ✅ No warnings found
- ✅ Build completes successfully
