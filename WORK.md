# Vexy SVGO Work Progress - Current Iteration (2025-07-14)

## Current Iteration Tasks - Build Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

### Build and Compilation Fixes - COMPLETED ✅
- ✅ Fixed jsonschema dependency missing in crates/core/Cargo.toml
- ✅ Fixed borrowing issue in config.rs by cloning the config value
- ✅ Fixed CliError not found - replaced with VexyError::Io
- ✅ Fixed VexySvgoError typo - corrected to VexyError
- ✅ Fixed WASM crate imports - added proper imports for Config and PluginConfig
- ✅ All crates now compile successfully

## Summary of Build Fixes Applied

### 1. Core Crate Fixes:
- Added `jsonschema = { workspace = true }` to crates/core/Cargo.toml dependencies
- Fixed borrowing issue in parser/config.rs by using `config.clone()` when passing to serde_json::from_value

### 2. CLI Crate Fixes:
- Replaced non-existent `CliError::InvalidDirectory` with `VexyError::Io` 
- Fixed typo `VexySvgoError` to `VexyError` in is_excluded function

### 3. WASM Crate Fixes:
- Added imports: `use vexy_svgo_core::{Config, PluginConfig, optimize_with_config};`
- Removed fully qualified paths like `vexy_svgo_core::config::PluginConfig` in favor of imported `PluginConfig`

## Previous Work Summary

### Testing & Documentation Phase - COMPLETED ✅
- ✅ Fixed 207 compilation errors across plugin-sdk
- ✅ Created comprehensive unit tests for parser module
- ✅ Created additional integration tests for CLI features
- ✅ Enhanced performance benchmarks with SVGO comparison
- ✅ Created shell scripts for comprehensive benchmarking
- ✅ Enhanced API documentation with rustdoc comments
- ✅ Created comprehensive WebAssembly usage guide

### Infrastructure:
- ✅ Benchmark Scripts: Automated tools for comparing performance against SVGO
- ✅ Memory Analysis: Tools for profiling memory usage with large SVG files
- ✅ Build System: Fixed all compilation errors and warnings

## Next Steps (from TODO.md):
- Implement memory-efficient parsing strategies
- Add memory usage limits and controls
- Optimize AST memory layout
- Profile and optimize hot paths
- Implement SIMD optimizations where applicable
