## Summary of Completed Work

### Testing Enhancements:
1. **Parser Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests covering all parser functionality including streaming, error handling, and edge cases
2. **CLI Integration Tests**: Tests for parallel processing, memory limits, streaming mode, plugin configuration, and various output formats
3. **Compatibility Tests**: Extensive tests ensuring SVGO configuration format compatibility
4. **Performance Benchmarks**: Direct comparison benchmarks against Node.js SVGO implementation

### Documentation Improvements:
1. **API Documentation**: Added comprehensive rustdoc comments to core public APIs
2. **CLI Examples**: Expanded with real-world scenarios, platform-specific examples, and integration patterns
3. **WebAssembly Guide**: Complete guide covering browser usage, Node.js integration, bundler plugins, and performance optimization
4. **Memory Profiling Tools**: Both shell script and Rust example for analyzing memory usage patterns

### Infrastructure:
1. **Benchmark Scripts**: Automated tools for comparing performance against SVGO
2. **Memory Analysis**: Tools for profiling memory usage with large SVG files
3. **Build System**: Fixed all compilation errors and warnings

## Next Steps (from TODO.md):
- Implement memory-efficient parsing strategies
- Add memory usage limits and controls
- Optimize AST memory layout
- Profile and optimize hot paths
- Implement SIMD optimizations where applicable
