## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


# SVG Optimization Core Architecture

The system implements specialized SVG optimization through a multi-layered architecture:

## Optimization Engine
- Multi-mode optimization with Balanced/Speed/Compression profiles
- Custom error handling modes: lenient, strict, auto-fix
- Specialized SVG validation rules including ViewBox verification and namespace validation
- Progressive optimization pipeline for streaming large files
- Importance: 95

## Plugin System
1. Core Plugin Architecture
- Registry of 53 SVGO-compatible plugins for SVG transformation
- Visitor pattern implementation for SVG element traversal
- Plugin communication through shared visitor context
- Plugin dependency resolution system
- Importance: 90

2. Transformation Categories
- Structural optimizations (collapseGroups, removeEmptyContainers)
- Shape conversions (convertShapeToPath, mergePaths) 
- Color normalization (convertColors, minifyStyles)
- Path data optimization with configurable precision
- Importance: 85

## Domain-Specific Processing Rules
- SVG-specific AST optimizations maintaining document validity
- Color format standardization logic and conversion hierarchies
- Path merging algorithms for compatible SVG paths
- Transform matrix optimization and combination rules
- Importance: 90

## Core File Locations
- vexy_svgo/src/optimizer.rs: Core optimization engine
- vexy_svgo/src/plugins/: Plugin implementations
- vexy_svgo/src/parser.rs: SVG parsing logic
- crates/plugin-sdk/src/plugins/: Core transformation rules

The architecture focuses on maintaining SVG validity while maximizing optimization through specialized transformation rules and plugin orchestration.
